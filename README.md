# CryptoCoin App

Dear reviewers,

Thank you for taking the time to review my project.

For this implementation, I followed the MVC pattern for the UI and built the app using UIKit. In the future, I plan to separate the project into multiple schemes to keep the business logic platform-agnostic. This would allow me to run tests on a macOS target for faster feedback and make the app easier to port to other platforms like SwiftUI, tvOS, or watchOS.


### How to Build and Run the App
- Clone the repo: 
	- `https://github.com/gtsofa/CryptoCoin.git`
- Navigate to the project directory
- Open the project in Xcode:
	- Run: `open Prototype/Prototype.xcodeproj/` in Terminal, 
	- Or manually double-click the `.xcodeproj` file.
- Run the project:
	- Press the Run button in Xcode,
	- Or use `Command + R`,
	- Or from the Xcode menu: `Product > Run`.

### Assumptions and Decisions:
- I assumed the 10-day duration referred to weekdays only. I should have confirmed this earlier, as I ended up rushing near the end.

- I also assumed the CoinRanking API responses were straightforward. Unfortunately, I discovered later that the coin icons were in SVG format. In hindsight, it would have been better to prototype early to catch this before diving into architecture and networking.

### Challenges & How I Handled Them:
- The coin icons were returned as SVGs, so I integrated an SVG rendering library to handle and display them correctly.

- My original goal was to build a clean, modular, and scalable architecture. However, due to time constraints, I opted to prioritize delivering the core features in a working prototype. In retrospect, I should have requested more time sooner.


Please let me know if there's anything youâ€™d like me to clarify or improve further. Thank you again for the opportunity!

Best regards,
Julius Nyule

## Project Description:
Create an iOS application that fetches data from the CointRanking API and displays a list of the top 100
cryptocurrency coins paginated, showing 20 characters per page.

## Requirements

### Screen 1: Top 100 Coins List
- Display a list of all the top 100 coins, with a pagination (load 20 characters at a time).
- Each list item should include:
	- Icon
	- Name
	- Current price
	- 24 Hour performance

- Implement filtering functionality to allow the users to filter the list by highest price, and best 24-hour performance.
- Implement swipe left to favorite a coin

### Screen 2: Cryptocurrency details:
- Provide a detailed view of a selected coin displaying the following information:
	- Name
	- Performance chart/graph
	- Performance filters for the graph
	- Price
	- Other statistics

### Screen 3: Favorites Screen:
- Provide a screen that will display a list of all your favorite cryptocurrency coins.
- The user should be able to view the details of each of the favorite coins.
- The user should be able to swipe left to unfavorite a coin from the list.
